## Introduction

This section describes Z3's handling of strings and sequences.
Strings are represented as a sequence of Characters. The default character sort is Unicode.
You can reason about regular expressions of sequences. Regular expressions are described in the next secion.
Z3 offers built-in support for 
using string constants and dedicated solvers for checking
satisfiability over constraints using strings and sequences.
Note that the (current) specialized solver is able to establish
satisfiability for a non-trivial class of formulas, but is far from 
a decision procedure even for fragments of string equalities that can be decided: 
Z3 only solves string equalities using an incomplete 
heuristic solver
and the full combination of lengths and sequences 
(and regular expressions) is not decidable anyway.
In Z3, strings are a special case of sequences, and for the case of Unicode strings,
and regular expressions over Unicode strings seeks to implement the [SMTLIB2 standard](http://smtlib.cs.uiowa.edu/theories-UnicodeStrings.shtml).

## Strings

### Built-in types and constants
The name `String` is a built-in name for the String sort. 
String literals can furthermore be entered directly as literals 
delimited by quotes. The following example asks whether there are
strings `a` and `b` that concatenate to `"abc"` 
followed by `b`.

```z3
(declare-const a String)
(declare-const b String)
(assert (= (str.++ b a) (str.++ "abc" b)))
(check-sat)
(get-model)
```

### String literals
Z3 follows the proposed SMT-LIB2.5 format for string 
literals. Thus, strings are enclosed using double quotes. A sequence 
of two adjacent double quotes within a string literal is used as the 
escape sequence for a quote. So for example `"quote ""me"" on this"` 
corresponds to the string `quote "me" on this`. Other 
characters are treated as part of the string. For example, a newline within a string 
is treated as a new-line character. 

To represent non-ASCII characters the SMTLIB2 standard uses unicode escape sequences.
The escape sequences are of the form `\u{d₀}`, `\u{d₁d₀}`, `\u{d₂d₁d₀}`, `\u{d₃d₂d₁d₀}`, `\u{d₄d₃d₂d₁d₀}`, `\ud₃d₂d₁d₀` 
where `d` is a hexidecimal digit.

The following example shows
three ways to enter the newline character.

```z3
(define-const a String "\u{a}")
(define-const b String "
")
(define-const c String "\n")   ; this is not a newline character but \ followed by n
(simplify (= a b))
(simplify (= a c))
(simplify (str.++ a b c))
```

## Operations
Let us start out with a summary of available string operations.

  <tr>

    <td>Does <tt>s</tt> contain the substring <tt>sub</tt>?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>(str.prefixof pre s)</tt></td>
    <td>Is <tt>pre</tt> a prefix of <tt>s</tt>?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>(str.suffixof suf s)</tt></td>
    <td>Is <tt>suf</tt> a suffix of <tt>s</tt>?</td>

  <tr>
    <td><tt>(str.replace s src dst)</tt></td>
    <td>Replace the first occurrence of <tt>src</tt> by <tt>dst</tt> in <tt>s</tt>.</td>

    <td>Retrieve integer encoded by string <tt>s</tt> (ground rewriting only).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>(str.from_int i)</tt></td>
    <td>Retrieve string encoding of integer <tt>i</tt> (ground rewriting only).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>(str.&lt; s1 s2)</tt></td>
    <td>Lexicographic string less than</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>(str.&lt;= s1 s2)</tt></td>
    <td>Lexicographic string less or equal to.</td>
  </tr>  
  <tr>
  <td><tt>(_ char ch)</tt></td>
  <td>Unit string from unicode character code.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td><tt>(str.is_digit s)</tt></td>
  <td>A predicate whether string is a one of the digits 0 to 9.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td><tt>(str.to_code s)</tt></td>
  <td>Convert string of length one to the character code (an integer). Produce -1 if the string is not of length 1</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
  <td><tt>(str.from_code i)</tt></td>
  <td>Convert an integer in the range of valid unicodes to a string of length one</td>
  </tr>
</table>



Note that `(str.indexof s offset)` is shorthand for `(str.indexof s offset 0)`.
Also, note that  `(str.at s i)` is the empty string or sequence for indices that are either negative or beyond
`(- (str.len s) 1)`. Furthermore `(str.substr s offset length)` is empty
when the offset is outside the range of positions in `s` or `length` is negative or 
`offset+length` exceeds the length of `s`. 


## Examples

Basic string operations
```z3
(simplify (str.++ (str.at "abc" 1) (str.at "abc" 0)))
(simplify (str.indexof "abcabc" "a"))
(simplify (str.indexof "abcabc" "a" 1))
(simplify (str.substr "xxabcyy" 2 3))
```

A string cannot overlap with two different characters.
```z3
(declare-const a String)
(assert (= (str.++ a "b") (str.++ "a" a)))
(check-sat)
```

Strings <tt>a, b, c</tt> can have a non-trivial overlap.
```z3
(declare-const a String)
(declare-const b String)
(declare-const c String)
(assert (= (str.++ a b) "abcd"))
(assert (= (str.++ b c) "cdef"))
(assert (not (= b "")))
(check-sat)
```

There is a solution to `a` of length at most 2.

```z3
(declare-const a String)
(declare-const b String)
(assert (= (str.++ "abc" a) (str.++ b "cef")))
(assert (<= (str.len a) 2))
(check-sat)
```

There is a solution to `a` that is not a sequence of "a"'s.

```z3
(declare-const a String)
(declare-const b String)
(declare-const c String)
(assert (= (str.++ a "ab" b) (str.++ b "ba" c)))
(assert (= c (str.++ a b)))
(assert (not (= (str.++ a "a") (str.++ "a" a))))
(check-sat)
(get-model)
```

Contains is transitive.

```z3
(declare-const a String)
(declare-const b String)
(declare-const c String)
(assert (str.contains a b))
(assert (str.contains b c))
(assert (not (str.contains a c)))
(check-sat)
```

But containment is not a linear order.

```z3
(declare-const a String)
(declare-const b String)
(declare-const c String)
(assert (str.contains a b))
(assert (str.contains a c))
(assert (not (str.contains b c)))
(assert (not (str.contains c b)))
(check-sat)
(get-model)
```

Any string is equal to the prefix and suffix that add up to a its length.

```z3
(declare-const a String)
(declare-const b String)
(declare-const c String)
(assert (str.prefixof b a))
(assert (str.suffixof c a))
(assert (= (str.len a) (+ (str.len b) (str.len c))))
(assert (not (= a (str.++ b c))))
(check-sat)
```

# Sequences

The sort constructor `Seq` can be used to create sequences over any base sort.
For example, a sequence of integers is `(Seq Int)`, and `(Seq (_ BitVec 8))`
is the definition of `String`.

## Operations
Most string operations have corresponding sequence variants. In addition, there are operations
to create a unit sequence and the empty sequence over any base sort.

  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><tt>(seq.nth s offset)</tt></td>
    <td>Element at <tt>offset</tt> in <tt>s</tt>. If <tt>offset</tt> is out of bounds the result is under-specified. In other words, it is treated as a fresh variable.</td>
  </tr>

    <td>Does <tt>s</tt> contain the sub-sequence <tt>sub</tt>?</td>

  <tr>
    <td><tt>(seq.prefixof pre s)</tt></td>
    <td>Is <tt>pre</tt> a prefix of <tt>s</tt>?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>(seq.suffixof suf s)</tt></td>
    <td>Is <tt>suf</tt> a suffix of <tt>s</tt>?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>(seq.replace s src dst)</tt></td>
    <td>Replace the first occurrence of <tt>src</tt> by <tt>dst</tt> in <tt>s</tt>.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Examples

When inserting `b` at or after position 8, but before the length of the string, which is at least 10,
then the resulting string has the same length, and either character 8 or 9 are unchanged.
```z3
(declare-const s (Seq Int))
(declare-const t (Seq Int))
(declare-const j Int)
(declare-const b Int)

(assert (<= 10 (seq.len s)))
(assert (<= 8 j))
(assert (< j (seq.len s)))
(assert (= t (seq.++ (seq.extract s 0 j) (seq.unit b) (seq.extract s (+ j 1) (- (seq.len s) j 1)))))
(push)
(assert (not (= (seq.unit b) (seq.at t j))))
(check-sat)
(pop)
(push)
(assert (not (= (seq.len s) (seq.len t))))
(check-sat)
(pop)
(push)
(assert (not (= (seq.at s 8) (seq.at t 8))))
(assert (not (= (seq.at s 9) (seq.at t 9))))
(check-sat)
(pop)
```
