Z3's programmatic [API](https://web.archive.org/web/20201209030312/http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/projects/z3/documentation.html) exposes all available optimization features.
- [Follow this link for a tutorial on using optimization features from F#.] (https://web.archive.org/web/20201209030312/http://lonelypad.blogspot.dk/2014/08/f-and-linear-programming-introduction.html)
- The Solver Foundation OMP format offers several convenient features for expressing optimization problems. We provide a backend to problems formulated in OMP from [Codeplex](https://web.archive.org/web/20201209030312/https://z3.codeplex.com/SourceControl/latest#examples/msf/README)
- The Python API is also convenient for prototyping. The Optimize Python object is used when solving constraints with optimization objectives
