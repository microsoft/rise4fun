Z3 is a state-of-the art theorem prover from Microsoft Research. It can be used to check the satisfiability of logical formulas over one or more theories. Z3 offers a compelling match for software analysis and verification tools, since several common software constructs map directly into supported theories.

The main objective of the tutorial is to introduce the reader on how to use Z3 effectively for logical modeling and solving. The tutorial provides some general background on logical modeling, but we have to defer a full introduction to first-order logic and decision procedures to text-books.

Z3 is a low level tool. It is best used as a component in the context of other tools that require solving logical formulas. Consequently, Z3 exposes a number of API facilities to make it convenient for tools to map into Z3, but there are no stand-alone editors or user-centric facilities for interacting with Z3. The language syntax used in the front ends favor simplicity in contrast to linguistic convenience.
